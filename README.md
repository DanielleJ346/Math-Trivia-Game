# Math-Trivia-Game
A small Math Trivia game made with Java

This is a small project based off a scenario question: 
Java Collections Framework
Edureka is a company that specialises in developing educational apps. They recently hired you as a
Java developer to join their team. They have tasked you with developing a maths trivia game. The
maths trivia game will present a randomly generated mathematical problem to the user, and then the
user answers back with the answer and the game checks if the answer is correct or not. If the answer is
correct, the game must save the answer to a TreeSet.

Create a Java program for Edureka based on the information provided above. The program must
initially display a welcome message and should generate two random numbers in a range of 1 to
10 (of type int). The program should also randomise the operators and display the problem to
the user. After the user enters the answer, it should check if the answer provided is correct or
not. If the answer is correct, this answer should be saved to a TreeSet. Afterwards, the program
should terminate when the user enters “999” as the answer. Then the program should display the
contents of the answers in the TreeSet.
